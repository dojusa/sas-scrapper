The zoo became famous around the world for its large size where wild animals lived together as in wild nature.<br/><br/>The African Savannah<br/>Our African savannah became a trend-setter for modern zoos around the world as Sigvard convinced the zoo-community that it was possible for different species to live together in the same enclosure. The 23.000 square meters savannah enclosure is still today our main attraction. Watching different species in the same enclosure is off course an amazing experience. However, the main intention is to create as natural an environment as possible, in order to stimulate natural behaviors. This type of mentality has over the year resulted in good breeding results."

The story began in 1959. 2016 marks a new beginning, under the Creative Direction of Pierpaolo Piccioli. A new set of values, that are both of the moment and faithful to its heritage, are created: grace and delicacy, both as an attitude and as a silhouette; a celebration of individuality; emotional beauty; the blending and merging of different languages. Style is essential and impalpable. The idea of contemporary humanism leads a creative quest that revolves around the personality of the wearer. Vision, products, retail spaces share the same traits: from the one-of-a-kind Haute Couture creations to women’s and men’s ready-to-wear and accessories, from eyewear to fragrances to the boutiques, Valentino is synonymous of elegance, pureness, craftsmanship, uniqueness."
